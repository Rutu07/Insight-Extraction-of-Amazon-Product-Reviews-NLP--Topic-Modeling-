# Insight-Extraction-of-Amazon-Product-Reviews-NLP--Topic-Modeling-\
In today’s world of e-commerce, Product Reviews play an essential role for customers as well as Business owners. Given the amount of transactions occur online, it is manually tedious to identify sentiment of each and every product review. There are millions of products & 100s or 1000s of reviews for each prodcuts. Objective of this project is to build a multi-class classification model using Machine Learning Models to classify each review either as ‘Good’, ‘Neutral’ or ‘Bad’. Second objective is of Aspect classification of reviews. Aspect classifiction means summarizing the review & identified what topic does the customer speak about in the review. Example, a particular review might be about quality of screen display of a phone while other might speak about speakers of the phone & so on. For this use case, a type of Unsupervised Clustering model in NLP is used namely, Topic Modeling Algorithm (LDA & BERT). The main idea of both the use cases is to identify negative reviews of a particular product hampering business, in order to increase customer satisfaction.
